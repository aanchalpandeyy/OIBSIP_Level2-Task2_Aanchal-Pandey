                <h3>Mahatma Gandhi <span class="highlight"></span></h3>
                <p>popularly known as Baapu, was a major political and spiritual leader of India 
                    who led the country in the non-cooperation movement in 1922 and Salt march in 1930 
                    and later in Quit India movement in 1942 during its struggle for independence.
                    In India, Mahatma Gandhi adopted the policy of mass disobedience and non-violent 
                    resistance as weapons against the British Rule in India and followed a principle of
                    <em>Ahinsa(total Non-Violence)</em>.

                            is quickly exposed to the racial discrimination practiced there. He settles 
                            in Durban and begins to practice law. In 1894 he founds the Natal Indian 
                            Congress to agitate for Indian rights. Through that political organization 
                            he infuses a spirit of solidarity in the heterogeneous Indian community.</p>

                            punishment. Thousands of other Indians are imprisoned, flogged, or shot. The 
                            law is eventually abolished, though racial discrimination in the country 
                            continues. Gandhi returns to India in 1915.</p>

                            classes and religious sects, especially Hindus and Muslims. In 1920 he 
                            launches a noncooperation campaign against Britain, urging Indians to spin 
                            their own cotton and to boycott British goods, courts, and government. This 
                            leads to his imprisonment from 1922 to 1924.</p>

                            British tax on salt and results in 60,000 people being arrested. The pact 
                            involves Gandhi pledging to give up the satyagraha campaign and the British 
                            viceroy agreeing to release all those who had been imprisoned and to allow

                            of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan is a great disappointment to Gandhi, 
                            who has long worked for Hindu-Muslim unity. Rioting between Muslims and Hindus 
                            over the partition breaks out in many areas. Again Gandhi turns to nonviolence, 
                            fasting until Delhi rioters pledge peace.</p>
